# Chur

*"chur" - New Zealand Slang for Cheers (kinda)*

Chur is wrapper around `tonic-build` that makes it simpler to declare dependencies on other types.

At the moment it only supports github repos which it will download as tarballs.

there's an example in the [example](./example) folder.

will update with better docs eventually.
